# `getCurrentAudioTrack` method

## Description

Returns the information on the currently loaded audio track.
Returns `undefined` if unknown, if no content is loaded or if the content
has no audio track.

When set, the returned object has the following properties (same than for a
`getAudioTrackList` call):

- `id` (`number`): The identifier for that audio track. It is generally useful
  to for example set the audio track though a [`setAudioTrack`](./setAudioTrack.md)
  call.

- `language` (`string | undefined`): The primary language used in this audio
  track, as a [language tag](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).

  `undefined` if unknown or if there's no language involved.

- `assocLanguage` (`string | undefined`): A secondary language associated to the
  audio track, as a [language tag](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).
  Such language is often used in a different role than the language specified
  through the `language` property (e.g., written versus spoken, or a fallback
  dialect).

  `undefined` if unknown or if there's no language involved.

- `name` (`string`): Human-readable description of the audio track.
  If the `language` property is set, it should generally be in that language.

- `channels` (`number | undefined`): If set, it is the count of audio channels,
  indicating the maximum number of independent and simultaneous audio channels
  present in any media data in that audio track.

  For example, an AC-3 5.1 Rendition would have a `channels` attribute set to `6`.

- `characteristics` (`Array.<string> | undefined`): Semantic characteristics
  linked to that audio track, generally expressed as Uniform Type Identifiers
  such as accessibility-related metadata or commentary flags.

- `bitDepth` (`number | undefined`): If set, the bit depth in bits of the audio
  samples for every rendition grouped into that audio track.

- `sampleRate` (`number | undefined`): If set, the sample rate in hertz of the
  audio samples for every rendition grouped into that audio track.

- `bitDepths` (`Array.<number> | undefined`): Distinct bit depths in bits found
  among the renditions grouped into that audio track.

- `sampleRates` (`Array.<number> | undefined`): Distinct sample rates in hertz
  found among the renditions grouped into that audio track.

The current audio track should be known once the `audioTrackUpdate`
[event](../Player_Events.md) is sent for the currently-loaded content, which
should happen at least once before the content is in the `"Loaded"`
[state](../Basic_Methods/getPlayerState.md) (and thus before playback starts).

## Syntax

```js
const currentAudioTrack = player.getCurrentAudioTrack();
```

- **return value**:

`Object`: Characteristics of the currently loaded audio track (see previous
chapter). `undefined` if no content is loaded, if there's no audio tracks in
the loaded content or if its characteristics are unknown.
